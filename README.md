# README Generator

## About the Project
A quality README is important when creating an open source project on GitHub. The README will contain information about the project including a description, instructions on installation and usage, and other important information that will help new users understand the application.
This command-line application will quickly generate a README file by using nodejs inquirer to prompt the user for information.
